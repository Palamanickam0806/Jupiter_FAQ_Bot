    "answer": "No, lenders have strict verification processes to prevent this. But if someone somehow manages to misuse your PAN details, they could try to take out a loan in your name. It’s rare but not impossible. This is why it’s so important to keep an eye on your credit report. If you spot any loans you didn’t take, report it right away.",
