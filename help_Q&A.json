        "In April 2023, I received a message on WhatsApp from someone offering an online job promoting e-commerce product reviews. They asked me to buy the products and review them, promising that the product amount and a commission would be added to my account. They continued to add high-value products, and during that time, I was not thinking clearly and ended up giving around ₹615,800. They then increased the product value to ₹1.3 million and asked me to complete the task to withdraw the money, which I couldn’t do. The scammers used the name of a known e-commerce company, OnBuy (an England-based company), to deceive people. When I realized I had been scammed, I immediately contacted the OnBuy social media team, who confirmed that it was a fake website and assured me they would report it. Without informing the scammers that I was aware of the scam, I immediately filed a complaint with my bank and the cybercrime department and also visited my bank branch. The bank’s assistant manager confirmed that the scammers’ accounts were frozen and that the money was still there. Despite this, I received no positive response from the bank for a chargeback. I escalated the matter to the RBI, but their team showed little interest in resolving the issue and focused only on closing the ticket. I have emailed the bank’s CEO, but their senior management keeps telling me to follow up with the cybercrime team and that they will only proceed once they receive an update from them. Since then, I have been continuously following up with the cybercrime team, but the person handling my case often claims to be busy and is now not even responding. The RBI states that any scam reported to the bank within 24-48 hours will result in a refund, but I believe this is false because no one is helping, and I am still paying EMIs on the amount I borrowed. I don’t know how or when I will get my money back. If anyone knows a way to resolve this, please suggest a solution that does not require any additional money, as I have exhausted all my savings. I live with my parents in a rented house, and my salary is not sufficient. I am in a very bad situation right now."

But without even reading the question or understanding what I asked, the customer care responded like a robot (“The mail mentions credit card so tell customer to email credit card department, without even thinking”). Once the customer has contacted the company through the official contact email address, why does the customer need to again send mails to other people, and why can’t it be handled internally in the company?

Firstly, you didn’t even mentioned the actual query in the original post. You just mentioned “I had a simple question about jewel redemption”. Only after 21 days, you are mentioning your actual issue, i.e., “My question was very simple: can I redeem jewels to any bank account, that is, other than Jupiter bank account?” Secondly : You said you wrote the mail. It was unclear to which email you wrote since they have two separate mail ids support@jupiter.money for general enquires and edge-csb-support@jupiter.money for Rupay credit card related issues. My intention was simply to assist you in reaching the appropriate team and what I understand is that at present, you can redeem jewels (Converted to cash) only to Jupiter account.

The important point is whether the Jupiter management knows about the silo culture in the company, and whether they care about it. Given that they haven’t even bothered replying, and instead they’re freeloading on community members to answer such queries, I guess it shows how much they care. As for the 21 days to respond, fixing Jupiter’s internal problems isn’t really a priority for me. Some days back, they had sent an email about some new gimmick called 3-in-1 rewards, so I logged in to give them feedback on it, and that’s when I saw some notifications on this post.",

        "Hai @Muhamed_Vp Welcome to the Community. The initial credit limit is determined based on factors such as Credit Score and Repayment History. I think it can typically takes 6-12 months to become eligible for a limit increase offer, similar to other credit cards. For further clarification, you can reach out via email to edge-csb-support@jupiter.money if you’re using the CSB Edge CC."

Steps to update KYC online - (Active Debit Card is mandatory to proceed with this process online) Log in to https://accountopen.federalbank.co.in/CustomerPortal/index Enter your Bank Account Number You will receive an OTP on your registered mobile number There is a captcha post the above step Select KYC upload as the option and follow the next steps of uploading Address and Identify proof. Please note that the uploaded file size does not cross 2 MB. If you receive any error or do not have an active Debit Card associated with the Savings Bank Account, the only way to get the Re-KYC / KYC update done is by visiting the nearest Federal Bank. KYC as a process is under Bank’s jurisdiction and hence, all things related with KYC will be maintained and processed at the Bank’s end only as per the guidelines from the Regulator.",

The cost of production is steep — but is that part of the appeal? “Insiders at Revolut say its own metal card costs around £40 to produce, while an investor at Curve said its card had a £37 production cost (thanks to a US-based manufacturer).”",
        "Metal cards ideally should be offered for a very premium category card like the HDFC Infinia or Amex Black. A metal card in the non premium category fails to justify the cost involved in issuing it.",
        "Yes. My thoughts exactly. Also it doesn’t make sense for a debit card. Especially in India where the majority of cost conscious consumers may not want to pay Rs.5000 for a debit card."

The first video KYC executive asked me to contact Jupiter support at 8655055086 who then asked me to mail edge-csb-support@jupiter.money who just told me to retry Video KYC and they don’t have option to edit the mother’s name. I just retried another video KYC where executive said we cannot continue without details being matched. I also informed him that Jupiter support team is stating they do not have option to update the details. Seems like I faced a dead end because of this. I have 4 different credit cards of another banks and did not face such issue with either of them."

At least the unsecured ones. @Deepak_Joshi I got a credit card through my salary account in HDFC because SBI didn’t even take my application as I didn’t have a credit score. So HDFC considered that I didn’t have a credit score but I have a 2 years relationship with them. So I got a credit card and built my credit score and then got the SBI card. I would recommend you to get a secured credit card by depositing a FD. Using that secured card, you can build your credit score. Then you can get any credit card you want. Hope it helps… And as for automated systems, Jupiter is a new entrant and the fact is they can’t directly compete with the goliaths like HDFC, ICICI or for that matter even Federal Bank. So the costs could be kept minimal through automated systems. Hope you can understand that.",

It’s good that you are looking out for Jupiter but that does not mean anyone who puts up a complaint or feedback is trying to point out all negatives and is totally against Jupiter. If you like something you want it to be good! Especially when it has been good earlier. This seems like you are trying to start a debate on POSITIVES and NEGATIVES of Jupiter. Like you mentioned, anyone can share their experiences which is precisely what I am trying to do. Also, I am quite sure if someone mentioned something POSITIVE about Jupiter, you wouldn’t have mentioned that one should consider NEGATIVE aspects, as well. By the way, the COMMUNITY FORUM is not the only Positive thing about Jupiter. This is not meant to offend you or anyone but these kind of lines: ‘I completely understand your situation and the inconvenience it has caused for you.’ is like a trigger.

But a standard reverse charge applied by merchant to all cards.

I remember back in 2005, it used to be key USP for any CC as 0% surcharge for fuel and no other rewards. Fuel surcharges General Recently 10 rs Debited from my account as Fuel Surcharge after using Debit card on fuel pump. Thats mean, jupiter doesn’t provide fuel charge waiver. But, many times i have used my jupiter DC for fuel but its 1st time that 10rs debited as fuel surcharges. Can anyone explain this?:thinking: I have already contacted with team.

There’s no assurance that a user will receive a higher or the same loan amount after closing (even pre-closure) their existing loan. The outcome depends on multiple factors, such as their current credit score, creditworthiness, active loan accounts, credit utilization, a high number of loan inquiries, numerous other financial obligations, and more. Additionally, there is also a possibility that a user may be denied a new loan after closing their existing one. It’s important to note that the loan amount is not determined by Jupiter itself but rather by their lending partner."

        "@Anand_kumar_pandey Hai, Welcome to the community. At present, you can only change your mobile number if you have access to the app. It is better to enquire about getting the duplicate SIM of the old number from your SIM Company’s office. I also suggest you mail the issue to support@jupiter.money or call 08655055086 (available 9am - 9pm) You can also enquire about the same, if there is any Federal Bank nearby."

        "Hai @Akshay_Purwar , welcome to the community. I suggest you to use the chat feature on the app for a quicker response. You can also mail your issue to support@jupiter.money. Also, you can check the following threads for a possible solution Mutual fund insights report bug Bug hunters [Peek 2022-06-02 17-20] @Shawnpinto is was the bug that i was telling about… Check the issues with values. 1432 is my current value as per june 2… But insights are fetched on may 28(i had to manually request it)… To update insights everytime, i had to manually request for CAM mail and forward it… Shouldnt it be automatically updated? Consider shifting to MF central API Investments Club Jupiter Assets get the mutual funds from CAMS, and for some reason, it doesn’t show my total investments. I invest via DMAT format (Zerodha coin). Other platforms which use MFcentral are showing my total investments. External mutual fund dashboard not showing Help Hi, I don’t see the external mutual fund dashboard, nor the money dashboard showing amount, i just see explore option here, but don’t see the invested amount",
        "@Akshay_Purwar One probable reason could be because your mutual funds are in demat format. For example: Mutual fund investments through Paytm Money or Zerodha Coin are held in demat format. And Jupiter uses CAMS email statement for tracking your external funds. CAMS doesn’t get the demat mutual funds. I suppose we are in a great time of change in Financial India. So things are getting ironed out everywhere - CAMS, Jupiter, etc. As of now, MF Central tracks mutual fund investments in demat format. IND Money and Fi Money uses MF Central service as of now. But Jupiter is also planning to switch to MF Central soon. Guess we all need to be patient until then. Hoping soon is sooner.",
        "Also before Paytm Money, the number of investors for mutual funds through Demat format was very small I think.",

        "Hai @Ankita_Joardar Few months back, Jupiter launched a waitlist option to individuals interested in obtaining a salary account without the need for company-related information. The process simply required an automatic monthly transfer of 25,000 from their personal account, giving them to access the advantages of a salary account. However, this feature was temporarily suspended due to certain issues, and currently, it is not available. Moreover, I think a company email ID is must for the verification process when setting up a salary account. If I am not wrong, some users upgraded their account exploiting some loopholes and such account either got suspended or downgraded after some audit. So I hope someone from the salary team can give you clarification on this. Also, you can refer these two threads for more details.

Hence I would recommend raising a support ticket by emailing your issue to support@jupiter.money or by contacting customer care at 08655055086 (available from 9 am to 9 pm). Also, you can look for a duplicate sim, if the sim is registered under your name. It is easy to obtain one from the sim network provider’s office.",

I have raised this thread to update mobile number outside of the app or a way to get it done somehow.

Do you guys have a plan to roll some feature for this like have it updated via Federal Bank branch or if we can login to the app via registered email ID?",

        "HAI @Pratyushh Savings Challenge for iPhone took place last year, i.e., in 2022 (it was this challenge, we all got some jewels for taking up those quiz questions). The ongoing 6 week saving challenge has nothing to do with the jewels. May be you have redeemed you jewels or it may be due to the upcoming new reward structure. image817×342 25.2 KB Can you share the image/screenshot of the jewels page? (my earnings section)",
        "I did not redeem any jewels! That New reward structure update you mentioned is going to happen on 1st june! And that should not affect 1 year old jewels. It could be a possible bug due to update but that has not happened yet!",

        "For me, it seems like some bug associated with the new reward structure revamp. Anyway, lets wait till Shawn sees this post and hope we can get a confirmation from him.",

        "but this shouldnt have happened though.",
        "But the second edition of 6 week savings challenge, the one recently finished, has nothing to with jewels I think. In the first edition, there were an opportunity to earn maximum of 25 jewels per week after attempting weekly quiz. But couldn’t saw anything like that in this edition.",
        "Hello @Pratyushh , Clarifying what has happened here - this is with respect to Savings Challenge conducted last year. For some users , jewel amount was stuck in future redeemable state, and through a recent audit, these jewels got unblocked and debited from jewel balance. For you, we have noticed that you have completed the savings challenge in June 2022 as per our records, and we will credit you the deducted jewels within next 2 days ! (You will receive jewels as per new rewards structure, don’t worry on that ) Thanks! Note : This is not related to any jewel earning or redemption regulation and not connected with the New Rewards Structure change.",
        "Thanks sir for the quick action and also for the clarification @Pratyushh Be happy now Also, I kindly suggest you to close the thread since its resolved (of course after getting the jewels back )",
        "Hello @Ankit_Misra , Thanks for the clarification. Appreciate it! I am just wondering what caused this? Something wrong with the recent audit you mentioned here?",
        "During the audit, we identified jewels that were stuck in ‘redeem later’. Usually the reason would be the challenge was not complete and we need to debit those jewels. For some users , we noticed that the jewels were stuck inspite of having completed the savings challenge. For these users we do a debit and credit transaction. Your case falls into this bucket.",

        "Such issues are very rare which only a few people have to face. I am baffled as to why Jupiter treats its users in a double-faced manner. All users of the app should get the same system but Jupiter doesn’t do that. It is different for all people. Like just a few days ago in the scanner revamp almost everyone got the zoom icon but not me. Almost everyone has got the search icon but not @saurabh.s . Some people get updates early but some get delayed. Similarly, it is happening now that Jupiter has remained intense for you and very slow for some of us. When you make a conflicting statement in every post, the Jupiter team thinks everything is fine but we are lying.",
        "Manish, I will not deny that there have been difference in timelines when updates come through to everyone or difference in the app experience. Where you see me contradicting you, I see it as way to rule out variables so that a focused approach can be taken for troubleshooting. One also needs to work patiently to with the teams involved in the troubleshooting to take the issues to their logical closures which I am sure you do. Like I have mentioned, when issues are traced to specific user sets, then troubleshooting approach becomes user specific as well. I really cannot do much to change the way you perceive certain comments.",
        "I’ve spent a lot of time with Jupiter but as far as I can tell they may offer different versions of the app for everyone but when it comes to issues they don’t offer solutions for everyone’s issues one by one. They look at most cases from a general perspective and move to fix only when they see a problem common to most people. If the problem of some people is solved then still many people are left who have to face that problem. So I think instead of being double faced Jupiter should look at every problem in such a way that no one has to face it again.",
        "Guys Lets don’t fight, Honestly I think the only approach should be from the Jupiter Team for it be acknowledged as the Bug and start working or atleast note it down on their to do list. I have seen Jupiter app Bugs quite similar to Traditional Bank App Bugs like Yono SBI and HDFC. Well, I have seen IOS users not facing these issue (Never been Jealous of Iphone Users before )",

However, I would like to highlight the positive aspects of having debit cards. If you decide to upgrade to a PRO account in the future (I hope you are using a normal saving account at present), you can enjoy rewards by using your debit cards for spending, and this can even help waive certain charges. Another observation I made is that if you have registered for Net banking on the Federal bank website (I hope you haven’t), and you happen to forget your password, you may be required to provide your card details such as the card number and PIN to reset your password. I don’t remember if this information needs to be provided during the net banking registration process.",

If it still shows as failed, you can be assured that Jupiter will provide you with a refund. https://parivahan.gov.in/parivahan//en/content/amount-deducted-fee-payment-showing-pending-application-status Alan Sabu: How can I get it?? In most of the cases, the refund is issued automatically without any request or complaint. Raise a request only if you didn’t receive the refund amount even after a normal time period, say 2-5 business days.",
        "Agree with Abdul. I beleive the normal TAT for refund of a failed transaction is 5-7 business days. At least that has been my experience.",
        "First check your payment status, if it’s successful or not in the parivahan For license related payments⤵️ https://sarathi.parivahan.gov.in/paymentscov/PayStatusVeri.jsp For vehicle fees related payment⤵️ https://vahan.parivahan.gov.in/vahanpgi/faces/ui/transactionStatus.xhtml If the Payment got failed on parivahan site but showed successful on jupiter, then just send a mail or contact your state transport department, they’ll definitely process your refund.",
        "If the payment has failed on the merchant’s end but has been successfully processed by the bank, the merchant would need to initiate the refund process from their end. I think it will not happen automatically.",
        "May be I did generalise. A few days back while trying to pay credit card bills on Cheq, a few payments failed and the money did get deducted from my account. Cheq issued the refund in about 5 business days.",
        "But we’ll know this government sites are not do their work promptly. In my personal experience, I encountered a similar issue with a failed transaction and only received the refund after reaching out to the concerned department.",
        "Agree with your comment on the government agencies approach to work.",
        "Thankyou for your valuable time in helping me guys @razack @saurabh.s @yagnesh01 I feel happy to be a member of this community…As @saurabh.s bro said,i had just mailed to helpdesk-sarathi@gov.in regarding my issue to either refund me the amount or to make the transaction success…Special mention to @razack in clearing me all doubts regarding the issue…Rest Im going to wait today and i will update you guys after my issue gets resolved…",
        "Happy to help you brother. Please do not hesitate to post here if you have any further questions… Btw, this is me sitting in front of parivahan site from 10 am to this time, for upgrading the license to smart card… image1798×444 129 KB",

        "If you’re curious about our discussion, I regret to inform you that despite Kerala’s high rankings in various areas, our transportation department services remain stuck in the 19th century. Up until last month, driving licenses in Kerala were issued as laminated papers, causing embarrassment when compared to the smart licenses issued by other states. Happy to see some sort of change happening at last. The New Indian Express Kerala motor vehicles department starts issuing driving licences as smart cards Existing driving licence holders can also convert to the new smart cards by paying Rs 200 and postal charges.",
        "Abdul, in mumbai, sometime back our RTO had no clue how to proceed further as the contract of the company preparing the smart cards had expired and was not renewed. Initially, licence issuing came to a grinding halt and then, even though it was for a breif period, paper booklet based licenses were issued.",
        "The issue was almost same here too. Smart license distribution contract was handed to a private company in2019 and then some legal disputes occurred between the Govt and them. It took almost 4 years to get this solved Happy that finally its over.",
        "Try paying now…The server is back😃",
        "Forgot to gave update regarding the payment. Yes, I have made the payment few hours ago, and it was successful",

Shame on it. Please have a look at the ticket and see how useless ur team is, how uselesss a team can be? Yuck"
